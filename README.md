# Selection-Sort in C:
Selection Sort repeatedly searches for the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the end of sorted part of the array. 
Selection sort first finds the smallest element in the unsorted array and swaps it with the first element. 
Then it finds the second smallest element in the unsorted array and swaps it with the second element, and 
the algorithm keeps doing this until the entire array is sorted.
